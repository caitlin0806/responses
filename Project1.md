1) I feel like my video somewhat detected social distancing violations but it also missed a lot of it. It would count some violations but then the count would go down. I feel like it probably has to do with the video I chose. Maybe if I chose a video that had a higher angle it would have done a better job calculating the violations. It possible could have confused the algorithm. 
2) I do think that this somewhat has the potential of estimating new infections. There are a lot more improvements that need to be made for it to be more accurate and effective. Street cams are a great way to work this algorithm on. It views the public areas form a high angle which seems to be the main criteria for the algorithm to be more effective. 
3) Some improvements can include the fact that angles should not matter when calculating the violations. I wonder if what people wear also plays a factor. For example, if people are covered up (i.e. mask, or lots of clothes) could that trick the algorithm and make it confused when checking for a violation? So, that could be a limitation.
