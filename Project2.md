I chose to do a lion because they are my favorite animal and these majestic creatures are the kings of the jungle and are symbols of bravery, strength,and royalty. I am a leo and every school I went to, the mascot has been a lion (half a lion counts too), so I literally have been a lion all my life. I chose Andy Warhol's famous pop art as the filter because he is one of my favorite artists who just so happens to have the same birthday as me so shoutout to another leo.

For my t shirt entry I chose to take a picture of a microchip and combine it with the words of William and Mary. I thought it would be a cute idea for the letters to take the color scheme of the microchip that happened to also be W&M colors and can kind of symbolize the idea of data science and the role computers play.
