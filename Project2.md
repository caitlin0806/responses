I chose to do a lion because they are my favorite animal and these majestic creatures are the kings of the jungle and are symbols of bravery, strength,and royalty. I am a leo and every school I went to, the mascot has been a lion (half a lion counts), so I literally have been a lion all my life. I chose Andy Warhol's famous pop art as the filter because he is one of my favorite artists who just so happens to have the same birthday as me so shoutout to another leo.
